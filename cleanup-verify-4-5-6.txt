[VERIFY] infra/: PRESENT & NOT EMPTY -> KEEP (or migrate contents)
[VERIFY] studio-shell/node_modules: PRESENT (tracked=0)
         -> SAFE TO DELETE LOCALLY (cache), NOT IN GIT
[VERIFY] root next.config.ts present; workspace configs -> apps:2 services:2
         -> Likely REDUNDANT if each Next.js project has its own config; recommend delete in next cleanup batch
