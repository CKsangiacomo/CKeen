# Techphases.md (Phase-1, Freeze Version)

**Purpose**  
This document defines the technical phases of Clickeen across Phase-1, Phase-2, and Phase-3.  
It establishes which **systems** exist (codenames, responsibilities) and which **services** deploy them.  
This is the authoritative roadmap for humans and AIs.

- Sections marked **NORMATIVE** = binding specifications.  
- Sections marked **INFORMATIVE** = context only.

---

## Authority & Conflict Resolution (NORMATIVE)

- **DB Truth (`dbschemacontext.md`)** is canonical for schema and table definitions.  
- **System specs (`documentation/systems/*.md`)** (e.g., Venice, Paris, Geneva) are canonical for API/payload shapes.  
- **Techphases.md** is architectural guidance.  
- If there is any conflict: **DB Truth and system specs win.**

---

## Systems vs. Services

- **Systems** = logical architecture components with codenames (e.g., Venice, Paris, Bob).  
- **Services** = concrete deployable units (Vercel projects, Supabase functions, etc.) that host one or more systems.

Example:  
- Venice (system) = Embed Runtime.  
- c-keen-embed (service) = Vercel deployment that serves Venice.

---

## Codename Map (Systems)

- Phase-1 systems (scope; specs live in `documentation/systems/`. If a system doc is missing, treat it as informative until added; do not assume implementation.)
  - Atlas — Config & Cache Layer  
  - Berlin — Observability & Security (app/site surfaces; never embeds)  
  - Bob — Widget Builder UI  
  - Studio — Scaffolding shell (code in `apps/app/builder-shell/`, served at `/studio`; layout/nav/iframe isolation, shared toggles; not a standalone product surface)  
  - Cairo — Custom Domains  
  - Denver — Asset Storage & CDN  
  - Dieter — Design System  
  - Geneva — Schema Registry  
  - Michael — Data Plane  
  - Phoenix — Idempotency Layer  
  - Venice — Embed Runtime  
  - Paris — HTTP API  
  - Prague — Marketing Site

- Future systems (Phase-2/3, informative only; specs may not yet exist)
  - Copenhagen — AI Orchestration (not implemented in Phase-1; spec TBD)  
  - Helsinki — Analytics Warehouse (not implemented in Phase-1; spec TBD)  
  - Lisbon — Email/Notifications (Phase-2)  
  - Robert — Notification Router (Phase-2)  
  - Tokyo — Job/Workflow Orchestrator (Phase-2)

## Canonical Glossary (NORMATIVE)

- Widget — functional unit (e.g., form, FAQ).  
- Template — pre-designed style for a widget (layout + skin + density). Templates are data-only (JSON).  
- Instance — specific deployment of a widget (private config + publicId).  
- Draft — unclaimed instance created on first play; claim binds it to a workspace.  
- Embed delivery — SSR HTML from Venice at `GET /e/:publicId`.  
  - Consumers may embed via iframe (inline) or loader script (overlay). SSR HTML is canonical (no client React in embeds).  
- Single tag — the embed snippet a website places; widget type determines inline vs overlay.  
- Templates as data — structured JSON; switching templates changes config only, not code.

Casing: All JSON examples here use camelCase. For DB table/column names, always refer to DB Truth (`dbschemacontext.md`). Do not infer casing.

---

## Phase-1 Overview (NORMATIVE)

Scope
- Widgets: 20–30 widget types (GA list defined in Phase-1 Specs).
- Templates: 10–20 per widget type (~200–600 total).
- Renderer: one renderer per widget type; templates are data-only.
- Embed: versioned loader path, ≤28KB gzipped, tiny event bus (publish/subscribe).
- Per-widget budget: ≤10KB gzipped initial render.
- Plans:
  - Free → 1 active widget, includes “Made with Clickeen” branding
  - Paid → unlimited widgets, no branding, premium templates

Non-Goals
- Per-template JavaScript
- Client-side React runtime in embeds
- Third-party scripts in embeds (Berlin instrumentation lives only in app/site surfaces)
- Cookies/localStorage in embeds
- Phase-2/3 features (roles, deep integrations, enterprise)

---

## Guiding Principles (NORMATIVE)

- Product-led, self-serve
- Modular from day one (split only when scale demands)
- Size + speed are features (strict budgets)
- Security by default (RLS, scoped tokens, least privilege)
- DX matters (pnpm, linting, type safety)
- No guessing — escalate if unspecified

---

## Template Composition (NORMATIVE)

- Templates are JSON objects:
  - id, widgetType, layout, skin, density, accents?, tokens?, schemaVersion, defaults, slots?
- Composition precedence: `instance.config → template.defaults → theme.tokenOverrides`.
- Source of truth:
  - Paris — instance configs & entitlements.
  - Geneva — schemas/catalog.
  - Atlas — edge cache only (read-through); never authoritative.
- Renderer: server renderer per widget type → HTML string (pure; no inline handlers).
- Inheritance: variants may extend a base + provide diff; flattened at build.
- Validation: JSON Schema per widget type; invalid → 422 with `[ { path, message } ]`.

See also: systems/geneva.md (schemas) and systems/paris.md (catalog + instance creation).

---

## SSR Data Flow & Caching (NORMATIVE)

- Route: `GET /e/:publicId` (Venice).
- Auth policy (clarifier)
  - Published instances: public GET; no token required.
  - Draft/inactive/protected: require embed token (or workspace JWT in Studio).
  - Venice enforces branding exactly as returned by Paris (no client overrides).
- Steps
  1) Validate entitlements; validate embed token only if required (draft/inactive).  
  2) Load instance snapshot + entitlements from Paris.  
  3) Load template schema/catalog from Geneva (Atlas mirror optional).  
  4) Resolve config → render SSR HTML (+ “Made with Clickeen” backlink).  
  5) Write usage (pixel; idempotent; rate-limited).  
  6) Apply cache headers (canonical TTLs, ETag/Last-Modified, Vary; see Phase‑1 Specs for exact values).
- Preview parity (Studio): `/e/:publicId?ts=<ms>&theme=light|dark&device=desktop|mobile` (double-buffer, no white flash).
- Errors: TOKEN_INVALID, TOKEN_REVOKED, NOT_FOUND, CONFIG_INVALID, RATE_LIMITED, SSR_ERROR.
- Recovery: degrade gracefully with fallbacks when dependencies are unavailable.

References: systems/venice.md (embed, caching, CSP) and systems/paris.md (instance API).

---

## Widget State & Data (NORMATIVE)

- Presentational widgets: render-only (template + instance config).
- Data-collecting widgets (e.g., forms):
  - Endpoint: `POST /api/submit/:publicId` (Paris).
  - Server-side validation authoritative; client-side validation optional UX.
  - Anonymous submissions tied to draft token.
  - Retention: bounded (value set in DB Truth / Phase-1 Specs).
  - On claim: submissions re-keyed to workspace.

See also: systems/paris.md (submission endpoints).

---

## Builder (Bob + Studio) (NORMATIVE)

- Bob (system) — Widget Builder UI: configuration, previews, drafts, claim flow, template switching rules.
- Studio (system) — scaffolding shell (`apps/app/builder-shell/`, route `/studio`): provides container, layout, iframe isolation, shared nav/theme/device toggles, and error surfacing. Studio itself is not a standalone product surface.

Builder UX rules
- One working surface (no separate “library” screen).
- TopDrawer (templates) collapses by default; first template auto-applies; push-down (no overlay).
- ToolDrawer is Bob’s editor UI; Studio only provides shell & transitions.
- Workspace is always visible (iframe calling `/e/:publicId`); light debounce on edits; preserve focus/scroll; cross-fade preview.
- Mobile: drawers open as sheets; close back to Workspace.

See also: systems/bob.md and systems/studio.md (scaffolding contracts).

---

## Token Taxonomy (NORMATIVE)

- JWT — user auth (Supabase).
- Embed token — identifies instance/draft; scoped; rotatable/revocable.
- Usage/pixel token — usage events; idempotent.
- No “template tokens.”

See also: systems/paris.md (token issuance/revoke, rate limits).

---

## Behavior & Animations (NORMATIVE)

- CSS-first: animations/transitions via tokens & skins.
- Per-widget JS: allowed only for interactivity CSS cannot do (FAQ expand, form validation/async submit, testimonial autoplay).
- Bundle ≤10KB gz per widget behavior engine.
- CSP: no `eval`, no `unsafe-inline`, no third-party, no storage.
- Behavior is driven by config flags (e.g., expandMode, autoplay, successMode).

---

## Loader & Event Bus (NORMATIVE)

- Loader pathing: `/embed/v{semver}/loader.js` and `/embed/latest/loader.js` (CI alone updates `latest`).
- Event bus (overlays):
  - `.publish(event, payload)`
  - `.subscribe(event, handler)` → `unsubscribe()`
  - Buffers until ready
  - Events: `open`, `close`, `ready`, plus widget-specific events

References: systems/venice.md (versioned loader + bus API).

---

## Accessibility Baseline (NORMATIVE)

- WCAG AA color contrast; visible focus states.
- Forms: labels associated via for/id; errors via aria-describedby; aria-live for errors/success.
- Overlays: focus trap, Escape to close, return focus to opener; restore focus on close.
- All interactive controls keyboard-operable.

References: systems/venice.md (accessibility requirements).

---

## PLG Metrics & Attribution (NORMATIVE)

- Backlink: “Made with Clickeen” → `https://clickeen.com/?ref=widget&id={publicId}`.
- Funnel: impressions (widget loads) → link clicks → account creations.
- Storage: `userAttribution` (workspaceId, sourcePublicId, timestamp).
- KPIs: viral coefficient; unique domains (eTLD+1 via Referer); time-to-embed (firstInteraction → embedCodeCopied).
- Free plan: unlimited drafts; exactly 1 active instance (`embedCodeGenerated=true`). Downgrade → others marked inactive.
- Premium templates: badged; free users can preview but must upgrade to select.
- Expansion tracking: widgets-per-workspace over time; adoption order; average widgets/account.
