## Problem
Software buyers are overpaying for bloated, sales-led software while enduring poor UX; this drains budgets, slows teams, and leaves customers stuck with products they don’t love.
- **Economic:** Traditional B2B software is sales-led; companies routinely spend ~50–70% of revenue on sales/marketing, and those costs get passed to customers. Growth compounds the waste.
- **Experience:** Products are bloated, slow, and poorly designed. Enterprises pay steep premiums for marginal features they barely use.

## Why Now
AI resets software economics and speed. It enables rapid rebuild/iteration and makes it viable to deliver **pure self-serve** software that passes cost savings directly to customers. A tiny, universal widget embed lets us acquire distribution without sales overhead.

## Solution
**Clickeen** builds the next generation of SaaS that is **product-led, self-serve, and AI-iterated**. We start with **widgets as a high-distribution wedge (“trojan horse”)** to land on thousands of sites, then guide users into larger products. We out-iterate legacy codebases with AI while keeping the runtime fast and simple.

## How We Win
We win by aligning economics, distribution, architecture, and taste—so the product is obvious to adopt and compounding to improve.

1) Self-serve beats sales-led — No sales team means dramatically lower costs passed to customers.
2) Widgets as high-velocity PLG — Works for every business size, gets distribution, and guides users into bigger products.
3) Beautiful design is function — Not just how it looks but how it works: intuitive enough that onboarding is instant, scaling is automatic, and complexity disappears; lower churn because people actually enjoy using it.
4) Modular architecture from day one — Start unified (modular monolith), split into services only when scale demands it; scale indefinitely without rebuilding core abstractions.
5) AI-native architecture — Not retrofitting; every feature assumes AI exists (from authoring in Bob/Paris to guidance, defaults, and automation), turning iteration speed into an enduring advantage.

## Moat
Our defensibility is **great design and modern UX**—a standard of craft that builds trust, reduces setup friction, and makes Clickeen the product teams want to use and keep using.
- **Great Design is our moat.** We win on product taste and usability—**UX quality that rivals Apple/Stripe/Airbnb** is a core differentiator, not a veneer.
- **Design control built-in:** features like the **per-widget Light/Dark mode toggle** are native to the builder, making polished outcomes the default.
- **Breadth on a shared, tiny runtime:** 30+ widgets on a consistent design system (Dieter) yield a coherent, premium feel at low marginal cost—competitors with heavier runtimes or sales overhead can’t match our shipping velocity or economics.
- **AI-accelerated iteration:** faster learning loops turn design excellence into a compounding advantage.

## Phases (Trajectory)
We sequence outcomes to turn early distribution into durable product breadth and revenue while protecting our design-led, self-serve thesis.

- **Phase 1 — Distribution via Widgets**
  - Ship the first widgets + minimal infra; prove install → publish → usage on a tiny, universal embed.
  - Targets: embed (loader+runtime) ≤28KB gz; first widget entry ≤10KB gz; boot-to-render <1s (4G demo); one end-to-end path green (draft → publish → Atlas → render → usage counter).

- **Phase 2 — Low-Cost SaaS for SMBs**
  - Add roles/invites, self-serve billing, quotas/usage UI, and initial integrations—keep runtime fast and UX premium.
  - Targets: roles (Owner/Admin/Member), billing live (Stripe self-serve), ≥2 integrations, D30 retention goal defined.

- **Phase 3 — Enterprise-Grade Platform**
  - Layer SSO/SCIM, compliance, observability, and partner integrations without abandoning product-led simplicity.
  - Targets: SSO/SCIM, export/delete, incident/observability baselines, contractual quotas/SLA pilots.

## Risks & Mitigations
We acknowledge specific execution risks and lock in mitigations that protect the thesis (speed, cost, and design-led quality).
- **Embed bloat →** enforce hard size/perf budgets and dependency discipline; preview and production share the same path to avoid divergence.
- **Governance drift →** decisions captured in ADRs; a single source of truth for tooling; export/asset sanity checks.
- **Tenant safety →** RLS default-deny, scoped tokens, and no PII in embed events.

## Bottom Line
Clickeen exploits an AI-driven cost and speed advantage to deliver truly self-serve, **design-led** software—using widgets to win distribution first—so customers stop paying for sales overhead and finally get fast, beautifully designed, fairly priced SaaS that scales from SMB to enterprise.
