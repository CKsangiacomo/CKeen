## Problem
Software for businesses is fundamentally broken. 
- **Economic:** Companies spend 50-70% of revenue on sales and marketing, making customers pay for salespeople instead of product value. This sales-led model creates a vicious cycle where growth requires more sales costs which requires higher prices.  
- **Experience:** The products themselves are poorly designed and overly complex. Small businesses can't afford the tools they need, and enterprises pay massive premiums for marginal features.

## Opportunity
AI has transformed the economics of software creation. More importantly, AI enables rapid iteration and rebuilding at speeds that established companies can't match - they're stuck with legacy code and massive sales organizations. The companies that invested in S&M instead of R&D can't pivot. This creates a window for a new model: pure self-serve software that passes the savings to customers.

## Solution: Clickeen
Clickeen is building the next generation of SaaS: pure product-led, no sales team, no inflated prices, just great products distributed through self-serve channels. We start with widgets as our trojan horse - they get us onto thousands of websites. Phase 2 builds low-cost SaaS software for SMBs. Phase 3 delivers a full powerful SaaS platform for enterprises at a fraction of the cost of their current solutions. Each phase proves that self-serve can beat sales-led, and AI-powered iteration can beat legacy codebases.

## How We Win
1. Self-serve beats sales-led - No sales team means dramatically lower costs passed to customers
2. Widgets as high-velocity PLG - Works for every business size, gets distribution, guides to bigger products
3. Beautiful design is function - Not just how it looks but how it works. Intuitive enough that onboarding is instant, scaling is automatic, and complexity disappears. Lower churn because people actually enjoy using it
4. Modular architecture from day one - Start unified, split into services when scale demands it. Scale infinitely without rebuilding
5. AI-native architecture - Not retrofitting, every feature assumes AI exists
