# WhyClickeen.md

## Problem
Software for businesses is fundamentally broken. 
- **Economic:** Companies spend 50-70% of revenue on sales and marketing, making customers pay for salespeople instead of product value. This sales-led model creates a vicious cycle where growth requires more sales costs which requires higher prices.  
- **Experience:** The products themselves are poorly designed and overly complex. Small businesses can't afford the tools they need, and enterprises pay massive premiums for marginal features.

## Opportunity
AI has transformed the economics of software creation. More importantly, AI enables rapid iteration and rebuilding at speeds that established companies can't match - they're stuck with legacy code and massive sales organizations. The companies that invested in S&M instead of R&D can't pivot. This creates a window for a new model: pure self-serve software that passes the savings to customers.

## Solution: Clickeen
Clickeen is building the next generation of SaaS: pure product-led, no sales team, no inflated prices, just great products distributed through self-serve channels. We start with widgets as our trojan horse - they get us onto thousands of websites. Phase 2 builds low-cost SaaS software for SMBs. Phase 3 delivers a full powerful SaaS platform for enterprises at a fraction of the cost of their current solutions. Each phase proves that self-serve can beat sales-led, and AI-powered iteration can beat legacy codebases.

## How We Win
1. Self-serve beats sales-led - No sales team means dramatically lower costs passed to customers
2. Widgets as high-velocity PLG - Works for every business size, gets distribution, guides to bigger products
3. Beautiful design is function - Not just how it looks but how it works. Intuitive enough that onboarding is instant, scaling is automatic, and complexity disappears. Lower churn because people actually enjoy using it
4. Modular architecture from day one - Start unified, split into services when scale demands it. Scale infinitely without rebuilding
5. AI-native architecture - Not retrofitting, every feature assumes AI exists

## The Three Phases of Clickeen

### Phase 1: Widgets as Trojan Horse
We start with widgets — lightweight, embeddable tools that work for any business size. They are simple, high-value, and instantly distributable through self-serve channels. This gives Clickeen immediate reach: every widget placed on a website becomes both a value driver for the customer and a distribution channel for us. Widgets prove that product-led growth can generate adoption at scale without a sales team.  
**What we’re building now:** The first set of widgets and the supporting infrastructure (embed service, tokens, usage metering, billing hooks, system icons). This phase is about shipping fast, proving distribution, and validating that self-serve onboarding works.

### Phase 2: Low-Cost SaaS for SMBs
Once distribution is established, we layer on broader SaaS software for small and medium businesses. This software is priced accessibly — solving the economic problem that SMBs face with overpriced, sales-led tools. By leveraging the widget footprint, we already have trust and awareness in place. Phase 2 proves that AI-powered iteration and self-serve design can deliver powerful SaaS functionality at a fraction of the cost.  
**What this means for development:** Extend the platform beyond widgets, build modular but cohesive features, and ensure the architecture scales for more complex SaaS workflows while maintaining self-serve simplicity.

### Phase 3: Enterprise-Grade SaaS Platform
With the foundation in place, Clickeen evolves into a full SaaS platform for enterprises. The economics are radically different: because we never carried the burden of a sales-led model, we can deliver enterprise-grade features at a fraction of incumbent prices. By this stage, Clickeen is not just a widget company — it is a full platform that demonstrates how AI-native, product-led SaaS can disrupt both SMB and enterprise markets.  
**What this means for development:** Mature the architecture for enterprise scale (observability, compliance, integrations), while keeping the product intuitive. The goal is to prove that even the largest companies prefer product-led SaaS when it is powerful, affordable, and beautifully designed.

### Phase-1 Implementation Snapshot (FROZEN)

- **Services & Deployments:** Four Vercel projects — `c-keen-app` (Studio/Console), `c-keen-site` (Marketing), `c-keen-embed` (Edge Embed), `c-keen-api` (**Paris — HTTP API**).
- **Data plane:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS).
- **Edge config:** **Vercel Edge Config** (runtime read-only; any writes happen in CI with a scoped token).
- **Health:** `/api/healthz` returns `{ sha, env, up, deps: { supabase, edgeConfig } }` with 200 on pass and 503 on dependency failure.
- **Embed budget:** ≤28KB gz (loader + minimal runtime); per-widget ≤10KB gz initial render.
