### Runtime & Assets (Frozen)
- Vercel uses Node 20 as declared by `"engines": { "node": "20.x" }`.  
- Dieter assets are served as static files from `apps/app/public/dieter/` produced by **copy-on-build**. Symlinks are forbidden.
- Edge Config writes are prohibited at runtime in P1; all writes happen in CI only.
### Additional server env (c-keen-api)
-  — header  guard for admin endpoints
-  — provisioned by Vercel Edge Config Integration (read-only at runtime)

### CI-only variables (never set in runtime)
-  — Edge Config store id used by CI to publish config
-  — Vercel API token used by CI to publish config (rotate regularly)
